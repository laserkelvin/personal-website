I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My research interests cover a broad range of topics, ranging from developing artificial intelligence models for task automation, to complex mixture analysis with high resolution spectroscopy, to the discovery of new molecules in the interstellar medium.
