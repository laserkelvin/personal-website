 abstract = {Using chirped and cavity microwave spectroscopies, automated double resonance, new high-speed ﬁtting and deep learning algorithms, and large databases of computed structures, the discharge products of benzene alone, or in combination with molecular oxygen or nitrogen, have been exhaustively characterized between 6.5 and 26 GHz. In total, more than 3300 spectral features were observed; 89% of these, accounting for 97% of the total intensity, have now been assigned to 152 distinct chemical species and 60 of their variants (i.e., isotopic species and vibrationally excited states). Roughly 50 of the products are entirely new or poorly characterized at high resolution, including many heavier by mass than the precursor benzene. These ﬁndings provide direct evidence for a rich architecture of two- and three-dimensional carbon and indicate that benzene growth, particularly the formation of ring−chain molecules, occurs facilely under our experimental conditions. The present analysis also illustrates the utility of microwave spectroscopy as a precision tool for complex mixture analysis, irrespective of whether the rotational spectrum of a product species is known a priori or not. From this large quantity of data, for example, it is possible to determine with conﬁdence the relative abundances of diﬀerent product masses, but more importantly the relative abundances of diﬀerent isomers with the same mass. The complementary nature of this type of analysis to traditional mass spectrometry is discussed.},
