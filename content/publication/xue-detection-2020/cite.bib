 abstract = {We report an astronomical detection of HC4NC for the first time in the interstellar medium with the Green Bank Telescope toward the TMC-1 molecular cloud with a minimum significance of 10.5σ. The total column density and excitation temperature of HC4NC are determined to be cm−2 and , respectively, using Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis. In addition to HC4NC, HCCNC is distinctly detected whereas no clear detection of HC6NC is made. We propose that the dissociative recombination of the protonated cyanopolyyne, HC5NH+, and the protonated isocyanopolyyne, HC4NCH+, are the main formation mechanisms for HC4NC while its destruction is dominated by reactions with simple ions and atomic carbon. With the proposed chemical networks, the observed abundances of HC4NC and HCCNC are reproduced satisfactorily.},
