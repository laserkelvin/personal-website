abstract: "textlessitextgreaterContext.textlessi/textgreater Protonated molecular species have been proven to be abundant in the interstellar gas. This class of molecules is also pivotal for the determination of important physical parameters for the evolution of the interstellar medium (e.g. gas ionisation fraction) or as tracers of non-polar species which are not directly observable. The identification of these molecular species through radioastronomical observations is directly linked to precise laboratory spectral characterisation.textlessitextgreaterAims.textlessi/textgreater The goal of the present work is to extend the laboratory measurements of the pure rotational spectrum of the ground electronic state of protonated carbonyl sulfide (HSCOtextlesssuptextgreater+textlesssup/textgreater) and its deuterium substituted isotopomer (DSCOtextlesssuptextgreater+textlesssup/textgreater). At the same time, we show how implementing different laboratory techniques allows for the determination of different spectroscopical properties of asymmetric-top protonated species.textlessitextgreaterMethods.textlessi/textgreater Three different high-resolution experiments were used in conjunction to detect for the first time the textlessitextgreaterbtextlessi/textgreater-type rotational spectrum of HSCOtextlesssuptextgreater+textlesssup/textgreater, and to extend, well into the sub-millimetre region, the textlessitextgreateratextlessi/textgreater-type spectrum of the same molecular species and DSCOtextlesssuptextgreater+textlesssup/textgreater. The electronic ground-state of both ions was investigated in the 273–405 GHz frequency range, allowing for the detection of 60 and 50 new rotational transitions for HSCOtextlesssuptextgreater+textlesssup/textgreater and DSCOtextlesssuptextgreater+textlesssup/textgreater, respectively.textlessitextgreaterResults.textlessi/textgreater The combination of our new measurements with the three rotational transitions previously observed in the microwave region permits the rest frequencies of the most astronomically relevant transitions to be predicted to better than 100 kHz for both HSCOtextlesssuptextgreater+textlesssup/textgreater and DSCOtextlesssuptextgreater+textlesssup/textgreater up to 500 GHz, equivalent to better than 60 m stextlesssuptextgreater−1textlesssup/textgreater in terms of equivalent radial velocity.textlessitextgreaterConclusions.textlessi/textgreater The present work illustrates the importance of using different laboratory techniques to spectroscopically characterise a protonated species at high frequency. Each instrument addressed a complementary part of the same spectroscopic challenge, demonstrating the potential of such an approach for future studies of similar reactive species."
